### **Algorithm for Dataset Analysis in R**  
**Objective:** Perform various data analysis tasks using the `mtcars` dataset and a manually created bird dataset.

## **PART 1: mtcars Dataset Analysis**  
### **Step 1: Load the Required Library**  
1. Load the `dplyr` package for data manipulation.

### **Step 2: Load the Built-in mtcars Dataset**  
1. Load the `mtcars` dataset into memory.

### **Step 3: Random Selection of Rows**  
1. Set a random seed for reproducibility.  
2. Select `n` random rows (e.g., `5` rows) from the dataset.  
3. Print the selected rows.  

### **Step 4: Random Fraction of Rows**  
1. Select a random fraction (e.g., `30%`) of rows from the dataset.  
2. Print the randomly selected fraction of rows.  

### **Step 5: Select Specific Columns**  
1. Extract only the `cyl`, `hp`, and `wt` columns from the dataset.  
2. Print the extracted columns.  

### **Step 6: Filter Cars with Automatic Transmission**  
1. Filter the dataset to include only cars where the transmission type (`am`) is `0` (automatic).  
2. Print the filtered dataset.  

### **Step 7: Retrieve Cars with High Horsepower**  
1. Filter the dataset to include only cars with `hp > 225`.  
2. Print the cars that meet this condition.  

### **Step 8: Calculate Mean and Median of mpg**  
1. Compute the mean and median values of the `mpg` column.  
2. Print the computed statistics.  

### **Step 9: Sort Dataset by Horsepower (Descending Order)**  
1. Sort the dataset in descending order based on `hp`.  
2. Print the sorted dataset.

## **PART 2: Bird Dataset Analysis**  
### **Step 1: Create the Bird Dataset**  
1. Manually create a dataset with two columns: `Day` (Mondayâ€“Sunday) and `Birds` (number of birds observed).  
2. Print the original dataset.  

### **Step 2: Add Day Numbers**  
1. Add a new column `day_number`, where Monday = `1` and Sunday = `7`.  
2. Print the updated dataset with day numbers.  

### **Step 3: Remove the `Day` Column**  
1. Drop the `Day` column from the dataset.  
2. Print the dataset after column removal.  

### **Step 4: Find the Day with the Most Birds Observed**  
1. Identify the row where the `Birds` count is maximum.  
2. Print the result.  

### **Step 5: Sort Data by Number of Birds Seen**  
1. Sort the dataset in descending order based on the `Birds` column.  
2. Print the sorted dataset.

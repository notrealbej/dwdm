### **Algorithm: Neural Network and Decision Tree for Iris Dataset**  

---

### **Step 1: Load the Dataset**  
1. Load the required libraries: `neuralnet`, `C50`, `caret`, and `dplyr`.  
2. Load the `iris` dataset.  
3. Display the first few rows of the dataset.  

---

### **Step 2: Prepare the Data**  
1. Convert the categorical `Species` column into dummy variables:
   - Create three binary columns (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`) to represent species.  
2. Display the modified dataset.  

---

### **Step 3: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**  
1. Set a random seed for reproducibility.  
2. Randomly split the dataset into:
   - 70% training data (`train_data`)  
   - 30% testing data (`test_data`)  
3. Display sample training and testing data.

### **Step 4: Train the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN)**  
1. Define the neural network formula with the four feature variables (`Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length`, `Petal.Width`) as inputs and the three dummy species columns as outputs.  
2. Train a neural network model using `neuralnet()` with:
   - One hidden layer containing 5 neurons  
   - `linear.output = FALSE` since this is a classification problem

### **Step 5: Predict with Neural Network**  
1. Use the trained neural network model to make predictions on the test dataset.  
2. Convert the raw outputs into species predictions by selecting the species with the highest probability.  
3. Convert the numeric predictions into factor labels (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`).  
4. Display the final predictions.

### **Step 6: Train the Decision Tree Model**  
1. Train a decision tree model using `C5.0()` with `Species` as the target variable and the four numerical features as predictors.  

---

### **Step 7: Predict with Decision Tree**  
1. Use the trained decision tree model to predict species on the test dataset.  
2. Display the predictions.  

---

### **Step 8: Evaluate Both Models**  
1. Compute confusion matrices for both models:
   - Neural Network (`confusionMatrix(nn_pred, test_data$Species)`)  
   - Decision Tree (`confusionMatrix(dt_pred, test_data$Species)`)  
2. Display the performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for both models.
